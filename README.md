# IITDhanbad-DBR-Research

This repository contains the work I completed during my Winter Internship at the Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad under the guidance of Dr. Naresh Sharma.  
The project focuses on the simulation and analysis of Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM).  
It includes forward optical simulations, inverse parameter extraction from experimental spectra, and modeling of fabrication imperfections such as missing layers, extra layers, and thickness variations.

## Project Overview
- Implemented the Transfer Matrix Method in Python to model light propagation through multilayer optical structures.
- Performed forward simulations for TE and TM modes under normal and oblique incidence.
- Developed an inverse analysis code to estimate Bragg wavelength, stopband width, and refractive index contrast from experimental `.asc` data files.
- Introduced controlled noise to study the effects of fabrication defects and compared the simulated spectra with experimental data.
- Verified energy conservation (R + T = 1) and observed spectral shifts due to angular dependence and polarization effects.

## Tools and Technologies Used
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow (PIL), SciPy, and Jupyter Notebook.
